This will be a 10-minute (max) in-class team presentation/demonstration of your team's progress since milestone 3.  You should have a 95% working system, with a higher degree of "polish".  All SQL database functionality should be implemented for this milestone.  See the guidelines for [Team Project Milestone 4](assign/assign03.html).

This will be a 10-minute (max) in-class team presentation/demonstration of your team's progress since milestone 2.  SQL database functionality **is required** for this milestone.  A large majority of your classes, methods, test cases, and web page navigation should be implemented by milestone 3, as well.

* **Mar 21** - Posted an extensive example project on the [Resources page](./resources) that incorporates the Web Applications lab solution (Lab02) with the ORM Lab solution (Lab06).  It provides a web application front-end to the ORM queries, as well as demonstrates the use of login session information, and incorporation of a SQL database persistence layer with a many-to-many relationship.

* **Mar 14** - The midterm exam will be in-class on **Wednesday, 3-28-18**.  It will be open notes and you can use any resource on the CS320 website, as well as your lab solutions.  A practice exam will be posted over the weekend.  We will use Friday, 3-23-18, to go over an end-to-end solution for the books database we've been working with, as well as review for the exam.

* **Mar 9** - [Lab06: ORM](labs/lab06.html) is posted.  It is due **Saturday, 3-17-18**.

This will be an 8-10 minute (max) in-class team presentation/demonstration of your team's progress on your UI structure and navigation.  You should have the vast majority of your servlets and JSPs defined, and be able to navigate between most, if not all, of your pages.  Your HTML/CSS will still be in a rough state - don't worry about making it "pretty", focus on functionality over form.

* **Feb 14** - [Assignment 4: Individual Project Milestones](assign/assign04.html) **Individual Milestone 1: Baseline** is **due on Monday, March 12th**.  This will be a 3-4 minute in-class demonstration of your progress, to date.
