title: "Assignment 4: Individual Project Milestones"
---

In the [Schedule](../schedule.html) you will notice days designated as individual project milestones.  These are opportunities for you to demonstrate progress on your individual project.

This document describes the expectations for each milestone.

*Important*: For each milestone, make sure you come to class prepared to demonstrate your work.  If there is any hardware or software you need, it is your responsibility to make sure it is available and working.

*Important*: Each individual milestone demo canbe no longer than 3-4 minutes (in order for me to see all of the demos during class.)

> Date | Milestone
> ---- | ---------
> Monday, March 27 | Milestone 1: Baseline Prototype
> Monday, April 10 | Milestone 2: 33% Working Progress
> Monday, April 24 | Milestone 3: 67% Working Progress

## Expectations

**Milestone 1: Baseline Prototype**.  You should be ready to demonstrate some concrete progress on your project in the form of a basic prototype.  The prototype should support some of the functionality described in your proposal, but it can be in a very basic form.

**Milestone 2: 33% Progress**: For this milestone, you should be about one third of the way towards completion of the project.  There should be some substantial progress towards completing the proposed work.

**Milestone 3: 67% Progress**: For this milestone, you should be be about two thirds of the way towards completion of the project.  Most of the features described in your proposal should be implemented in some form.

**Milestone 4: Final Project Demo**. This is the completed project.
